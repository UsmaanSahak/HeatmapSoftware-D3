1 - Make it so when hover over or click legend entry, make the points similar in value to highlight
with a gold frame, so easier to spot.

2 - Make legend text enlarge when hovering over.

3 - Inherent mistake: In order for the x and y axis to be correct, you must have 83 total on the x,
and 28 on the y! In addition, you must fill out whatever value gives a null to 0, so each of the 28
strains has a value associated with each metabolite! make (dataset.length % 28 == 0) -> return true!

Instead it is placed in a way where there are 100 columns and however many rows via # of elements!


^^ LUCKILY, the work has been done for us in the new metabolite file, check email sent by chris, 
parse by 83 each.
